nah who needs a readme....
but seriously read this to the end to not get any errors bc error handling is non-existent.

BASIC SYNTAX:
PUSH <int>: used to push a number to the stack. can only push ints currently
READ: used to get user input
ADD: takes the top 2 numbers in the stack then adds them. this removes those 2 items from the stack then pushes the answer
PRINT <String>: used to print out a message to stdout.
JUMP.EQ.0 <LABEL>: used to jump to a label when the top of the stack equals 0 
HALT: used to mark the end of a program, if this is missing you get infinite loop :)

Labels:
Labels must end with a ":" A label can look like this >>>  L1:

By default, stack is always 256 spots in size.
will be adding support for a dynamic stack in python, java may or may not be updated.

so java side only works with integers. print statements can be strings. 
Will be adding more support for the python side, java is not looking to get many more updates :)

BTW: python will probably work better when it has better type support.

This is the JAIL programming language becuase this was so goofy to code. 
was about to use the .JL extention but julia got there before me so we use .jail instead.
